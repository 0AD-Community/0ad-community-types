Refactor the provided TypeScript declaration file that corresponds to the JavaScript API exposed by my game engine. Your task is to generate a comprehensive declaration file encompassing all available methods. To accomplish this, leverage information from both the implementation file and the provided usage examples.

When generating this declaration file, remember to assign the namespace 'Engine' to these methods, except in cases where a method pertains to a global constant. It is imperative that you meticulously rectify parameter names and types to ensure a precise correspondence with the equivalent C++ implementation.

While crafting the declaration file, ensure that each declaration is accompanied by JSDoc comments, serving as elucidating documentation. Additionally, for each function, incorporate a reference pointing to the corresponding C++ source, employing CPP function signatures like 'C++: JSI_GameView::GetCameraPivot.' Alongside, provide a comprehensive narrative detailing the functionality of each method.

Concentrate solely on this task, refraining from introducing any extraneous content into your responses.
